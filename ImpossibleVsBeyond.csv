The @chicagotribune says some Christian religious leaders consider #impossibleburger unacceptable during Lent because it's so close to animal meat that it's just cheating. This is perhaps the greatest product endorsement in the last 6,000 years.

Dear Chicago Tribune,

Please interview people who know what they’re talking about. The purpose of meatless Fridays has never been “solidarity” with the poor.

They could afford to rent an organ at $2500 for the wedding but not pay $200 for an organist. And giving him an impossible burger from BK instead of vegan food as promised is next level manipulation. Tough call, but good boundaries were set.

It wasn't just the food. She got him an Impossible burger with mayo on her way to the wedding, which was incredibly careless as well as thoughtless. She also was too cheap to pay him $200, when she could pay $2500 for an organist. She was clearly taking advantage of him.

No, an Impossible Burger is not a health-food substitute for a meat burger. But at 10:30 PM when I’ve just finished writing and am heading home, tired and hungry because Starbucks was out of tomato paninis... it’s nice to have a late night drive-through vegetarian option.

I am SO SORRY. But if FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS ARE SERVING YOU THE “FAKE MEAT” do you think it’s as healthy as they say it is? That means it’s CHEAP AND EASILY REPRODUCED. Beyond meat is FISHY AS FUCK. IMPOSSIBLE BURGER IS FISHY AS FUCKKKKK.... go eat some vegetables u nerd

Our friendly neighborhood @Applebees doesn't have the veggie burger patty, and I know people love that Impossible Burger but it tastes like meat and I don't eat meat, that's the point of a veggie patty 
there's so few options for hungry people who don't eat meat or fish

For Catholics and other observant Christians who go meatless on certain days during Lent, the rise of juicy plant-based burgers could be a welcome alternative to the parish fish fry. But does indulging in fake meat flout the spirit of the rule?

Who cares how much Landis used when it's not being destroyed. Plop a few houses into a cow pasture and no one is worse off. But try that in the middle of your monocropped peas for the impossible burger. It's a stupid complaint. Plus, most cows are grazed on nonarable land anyway.

Prediction: In 10 years, Americans will eat about one Impossible Burger's weight of plant-based meat weekly (4 oz).

In that case, meat alternatives will outsell seafood.

After chicken, beef, and pork, ""plant-based"" will be the 4th meat.

Like Americans only claim to fame in the food culture: a burger. How many fast food burgers places are just rolling in dough and everywhere. 

I know about the location of the impossible burger Manufacturing and HQ being near PP and stem cell labs.

And we consent by enjoying it

I'm still pretty steamed about that absolute muppet bragging about feeding ""a meat-eater"" a Beyond Burger without telling them. I'm allergic to veggie burgers. I'm allergic to the Beyond Burger, the Impossible Burger, and every other ""veggie"" burger I've ever heard of.

They had kids try three burgers, one beef, one Impossible Burger and one Beyond Meat burger. Most kids chose the impossible and some the beyond, none chose beef. When they told one kid his choice (impossible) was entirely plant based he said he’d never eat it again. Conditioning.

Impossible Burger healthy? Compared to a same-sized beef patty, an Impossible Burger contains a comparable amount of calories (240 to 260), but it scores lower in a few regards.The 1st is that it contains way less protein 19 grams versus 28 grams which may make it less filling.

I've tried Beyond burger and Impossible burger, and I think I prefer the former, because the latter tastes so much like meat it's freaky. But for folks who love meat but want to try vegan, Impossible burger is completely indistinguishable from a beef burger.

@Richzeoli Tried the impossible burger. I do the low carb diet, so I tried it (no bun) along side the true whopper (no bun). Believe it or not, the fake burger tasted better! Drawback...triple the carbs, and who wants to eat a chemical burger? Sticking with the cow.

The Impossible Burger at Burger King was exactly like a Whopper. Looked like a Whopper, tasted like a Whopper and the standard crippling bowel pain and diarrhea shortly ensued as well. I’d say you guys nailed it! Well done @BurgerKing!

Impossible Burger is just better than ground beef, with no reservations. I’ll never again eat ground beef where Impossible is available.

you don’t even have to go full vegan!! Go vegetarian, or just cut back on meat (esp red!) Baby steps are fine, and any little bit helps! Try an impossible burger! Switch to oat milk! It! Is! Cutting back on any animal products will! Help! The! Planet!!!

If you're bothered by the destruction happening in the rainforest please consider going vegan. Raising animals for food is the largest contributor to the destruction of the amazon. Dont give money to products that create the greatest amount of rain forest destruction, go vegan

The Impossible Burger is vegan.  Burger King sells the Impossible 2.0 which is the only Impossible burger on the market anymore & it wasn’t tested on animals.

The Amazon is burning (dooming the planet) to make way for cattle ranches, so people can eat more CHEESEBURGERS.
Do us one favor please. Go to Burger King, try the ""Impossible Burger"" and see how tasty it can be to eat less meat. (If you just can't, try a chicken sandwich!)

It's not a sham. They use grill boxes. The fat falls down. It's not like a griddle. Even if it were, it's still vegan. Cross contamination isn't a vegan concept. The Impossible Burger is much, much better for the environment than beef and is saving a lot of lives.

It turns out, the Impossible Burger has about the same amount of calories and fat but about 6 times the sodium / salt as a beef burger. If you have high blood pressure or want a heart attack, the Impossible makes that much more possible

Though these plant-based burgers are certainly a healthy option for the environment, you might be wondering: Are they any better for your body than regular beef burgers? https://tucson.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/plant-based-burgers-might-be-better-for-the-planet-but/article_74b309c3-bb6a-51f6-9e30-aec0af52f867.html#utm_campaign=blox&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social …

My enjoyment of an impossible burger is completely separate from any animal harm. If I eat one or not, the number of animals harmed before, during, or after eating does not change as a meaningful result. 

That's why I include it in my veganism.

first time eating a Beyond Burger, texture-wise, it's pretty close to beef, slightly mealier, but between a bun, it's close, taste-wise, it's more nutty, reminds me of like sunflower seeds and nuts, it's a pretty good substitute but the Impossible Burger tastes way more beefy

My verdict on the impossible burger:

It is the second most disgusting thing I’ve ever tasted.

First most disgusting is an unwashed dick. (Which I instantly spat out, and all further offers of dick-related activity from that guy were vehemently rejected.)

Is Impossible Burger an ultraprocessed food & the future of plant-based proteins asks Joanna Kane-Potaka @ICRISAT ? Or should we be eating protein rich ingredients like lentils, pulses, amaranth and beans in their whole form & mixed in real foods? #eatforum19 #foodwithinpact

I get to try an impossible burger. I told myself it’s not something I ever want to eat, ever, I mean I'm worried it could make me obsolete. Then an industry group said it might cause cancer. That pissed me off so much, I want like one. Spite is an effective motivator.

Beyond selfish motives, I have a larger concern: People aren’t going to eat more vegetables until vegetables become enticing to eat. Novelty foods like the Impossible Burger reinforce the worst habit, which is assuming that meals have to be built around meat, often bland meat.

Bad news for those wanting to avoid carcinogenic glyphosate (roundup) in foods.

0.1 ppb is enough to cause gut issues, beyond burger contains 1.0 ppb and impossible burger contains 11.3 ppb

Hi, @JenniferHorn. Please don’t use the word “healthy” so loosely. There is nothing “healthy” about a @BurgerKing Impossible Burger. It is a carby soy bomb and the only thing it makes possible is diabetes. Get a lettuce wrapped double Whopper instead. @VinnieTortorich #nsng #keto

The Impossible Burger - it's nutritionally inferior to the real thing and they should really move the marketing away from health.

It's a fine ""burger"" option for vegans - which is how it should be presented instead of fake health claims.

There’s a lot of confusion between @ImpossibleFoods Impossible Burger and the various products from @BeyondMeat. It’s great whenever anyone replaces animals in their diet, but these plant-based meats are REALLY different and it’s important that people know what they’re eating.

It’s impossible for the impossible burger to be in Burger King so they announced it on April fools. 

But the impossible happened so the impossible burger is gonna be in Burger King. 

Though it’s impossible for the impossible burger to be a real burger.

Hangry grouse: I am really annoyed that Impossible Burger has become the new trend in ""this is our one vegetarian option"" at restaurants. Their products are made with wheat protein. No one who has to avoid wheat or gluten can eat them.

Here's another objection to the Impossible Burger. Why can't we just eat plant foods as plant foods? But insisting that veg are delicious doesn't make it so for others. Most people simply do not want to eat vegetables, and they do want to eat meat.

I think the thing that bothers me most about these fake meats, oops, meat alternatives, is that they are *pretending* to be #meat, #dairy, etc. Vegetables are soooo delicious on their own—many prepare them beautifully—why do we prop up #industrialfood this way?  #impossiblefoods …

Me: So you don't eat meat?
Vegan: It's murder.
Me: So you grind up vegetables and add industrial oils and beet juice for an Impossible Burger that bleeds just like meat?
Vegan: Yeah... but even Mother Theresa enjoys Tarantino movies.

Correlation or causation? How did weak ‘meat to cancer’ evidence provided by Oxford postdoctoral fellow Dr. Springmann (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204139 …) made it into the scientific lit? The journal was PLOS (founded by Dr. Patrick Brown, CEO of Impossible Burger https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLOS ).

For me, Beyond tasted like a great veggie burger, but I could tell it wasn't meat.

The Impossible burger was mind-blowing. It tasted like meat in every single way. It's incredibly good.

The plant-based Impossible Burger uses around 75% less water, generates 87% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and requires 95% less land than beef.

It’s already in 3,000 restaurants, and now @ImpossibleFoods is planning to double production: https://buff.ly/2vvG6n0

Last week, the FDA approved the “Impossible Burger” — an all-veggie burger that ""bleeds"" and sizzles just like meat. 

Days later, Europe's highest court issued a very different decision.

oh, and btw, today you're promoting avocados - for the record there's more fat in an avocado than in an Impossible Burger, and pretty much all an avocado's calories come from fat - so why don't you call them the ""unhealthiest fruit on the market""?

IMPOSSIBLE (TO EAT) BURGER—not good for you. Preformed heme in foods is one of the suggested mechanisms by which meat causes cancer. The Impossible Burger is over 50% fat, most is saturated fat, as bad as lard. Choose the BEYOND (delicious) BURGER or other TRULY #VEGAN burgers.

The Impossible Burger is made entirely from plants but smells, sizzles, bleeds & tastes gloriously meaty. Served on a brioche bun & choice of fries or a side salad!

As @WhiteCastle launches the new plant-based Impossible Burger, it is time that @McDonalds offers a meatless option in the United States. Sign and share to tell McDonald's America wants a veggie burger with fries. https://chn.ge/2KZEeIN

The most encouraging sign about fake meat like Impossible Burgers becoming mainstream is not that you can order them at fancy restaurants like Cockscomb, in SF.

It's that when you order an Impossible Burger at Cockscomb, they ask: ""Would you like that with foie gras on top?""

Restaurants: please, I implore you. If you have a decent black bean burger, please don't replace it with an Impossible Burger. 

(And if you have an Impossible burger, know how to cook it.)

I means, it's fine. Just fine. But better than Boca doesn't mean it's the best option.

If anyone is ever in Ocala Florida you have to go to the Ocala Downtown Diner. They recently added an entire vegan menu and are going to be adding more options because the demand for vegan has been so high. They carry the Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger. So delicious!!!

Igredients wise, the only thing I would note is that Lightlife uses spices that may trigger IBS. I have IBS due to my Diabetes but I also have digestive enzymes so I was ok eating it! I don't need enzymes for the Beyond Burger. It has ""natural flavors"". But how does it taste?

Nutrition wise, the Beyond Burger is significantly more low carb than the Lightlife one. This is important if you're keto or Diabetic. With the Beyond Burger, I don't have to take insulin if I eat 1 patty. I do have to take insulin with Lightlife.

Blatner points out that when it comes to calories and saturated fat, the Beyond Burger is about equal to a grass-fed beef burger (Beyond's saturated fat comes from coconut oil and cocoa butter), and it has far more sodium than its animal-based counterpart.

@BeyondMeat Just tried the Beyond Burger. Amazing flavor and super meat-like. With a little mustard I'm sure I wouldn't be able to tell it apart from a beef burger. Maybe even better 
But...
The packaging is a nightmare. Gobs of single-use number 5 plastic. Do better please!

No I agree they shouldn't be using names or terms for products that manipulate the fact it's not ""meat""! When the Beyond Burger first came out I had no idea it was not made with meat, and ordered it after taking one bite and being disgusted threw it away! Waste of money! Not cool

What’s crazy is positive reinforcement would have worked just as well. Pretending the stuffed animal said yes and ate it and hugging it and getting real over the top hype about it would have had the same affect. But you choose the threat of physical abuse to manipulate a baby.

You don’t have to go vegan over night. Cutting meat and dairy out a little at a time is better than nothing. There’s so many amazing substitutes out there. Craving a burger & you see beef vs a beyond burger at the store? Go ahead and get that beyond burger!

I was involved in a blind tasting between a real beef burger patty and a beyond burger patty. No confusing the two. Real meat was satiating. Beyond burger had an artificial savoury flavour, and I was hungrier after finishing it - just like junk food designed to make you eat more.

Yesterday I went to a restaurant and they had a beyond burger on the menu. Please tell me why it could not be veganized and the only vegan option they had was a salad What’s the point of having a vegan burger on the menu if the dish can’t be made vegan???

Meat substitutes, like the Impossible Burger or @BeyondMeat Meat, are far from healthy. They're loaded w/processed ingredients and also contain GMOs and pesticides. Tests show that an Impossible Burger has 11x as much glyphosate as a Beyond Burger.

The Beyond burger is certainly an impressive feat of cookery. And we can't get away from animal agriculture quickly enough, given the two-pronged crisis of climate breakdown and habitat loss.

The new generation of faux animal foods will mainstream veganism. That's a good thing.

As a long-time vegetarian, I'll admit I love the Beyond burger. It tastes great and while processed it's definitely real (sourced from a dozen fruits and veggies plus a few natural flavorings - no palm oil). Not healthfood - but it's a *burger* ffs.

first time eating a Beyond Burger, texture-wise, it's pretty close to beef, slightly mealier, but between a bun, it's close, taste-wise, it's more nutty, reminds me of like sunflower seeds and nuts, it's a pretty good substitute but the Impossible Burger tastes way more beefy

Why are you comparing Beyond Burger with 90/10 ""lean"" beef? Beyond Burger is clearly more comparable to 80/20 Beef, which is generally preferred as a burger-making meat, which Beyond Burger beats

@Beyondmeat will eventually make a 90/10 comparable product. This is moot.

The production of a meatless ""Beyond Burger"" generated 90% less greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent beef burger. WOW. Listening to @scifri then I'm going to run out for a meatless burger!

When comparing a Beyond burger (or similar junk) with the real thing, please avoid lazy generalizations based on global numbers. Does the global livestock system need fixing? Yes. But make sure to act where it is needed and not to harm systems that work well.

.@BeyondMeat sold around 11.8M pounds of the Beyond Burger in 2018. Since 93% of their consumers eat meat, let's assume a 75% counterfactual replacement of beef–8.9M pounds total. A cow yields ~490 pounds of beef meaning that's 18,000 cows were spared in 2018. Very impressive!

Would you choose a plant-based burger over beef if they looked, smelled and tasted exactly the same?

If y'all think the Beyond Burger isn't vegan anymore, you'll be fucking shocked to find out how many other vegan alternative foods/snacks/drinks involved taste-testing the animal-product version to get the taste right. I hope you plan to research and boycott all of them too.

Lifehack for ordering the Beyond Burger at A&W: Go online and use one of their coupons (e.g. for the mama burger - modify no sauce or whatever) and SWAP the patty for the Beyond burger = save a bunch of money! I spent $15 the first time, and I just spent $5 for the same thing.

“Beyond Burger” 

Better than any veggie burger I’ve ever had though by itself, definitely has that “this-is-not-meat-this-is-a-plant” taste. In a burger, can kinda tell but not much. Lots of healthy protein there. Would order again.

carl’s jr. beyond burger hack

order the big burger (no cheese)

substitute the beyond patty

the burger itself only come with ketchup, mustard, onions, pickle 

it comes out to be $2-3 cheaper than getting the actual beyond burger

u can always add lettuce/tomato

Ooooh new plant-based vegan burgers infiltrating the Woolies meat section. Looks like a Beyond Burger. A fraction of the cost. Let's hope they taste even half as good. We will see!   – at Woolworths

Advice to my fellow vegans,

If you decide to hit up Carls Jr for the beyond burger order the California double and customize instead of the Beyond Famous Star. It saves about $0.50 BUT most of them don't know how to charge for the beyond patties. I subbed for free 3x in a row

Yesterday, a very scary climate report was released, but we all have the power to do something about it. Plant-Based Burgers are more sustainable than those made from beef.

I learned that the beyond burger is not only slightly healthier, but also has carbs and fiber which will supply more energy and keep you regular AND no animals harmed and less impact on the environment?? And taste better than meat??? thanks for clearing that up

Why even write this? Did the beef industry pay you? I really liked how your smoking gun argument was ""IT'S NOT EVEN MADE OUT OF REAL VEGETABLES!!!"" um ok?  Neither is beef, but at least no one had to die for the Beyond Burger. Also, beef is terrible for environmental reasons.

Sure, I totally trust someone on the National Dairy Council to tell me “if you’re turning to the Beyond Burger to save on fat or cals, you’ll be disappointed” even though the burger literally has less fat and lower calories than beef.

“Not able to prepare vegan style”
I asked them if it’d be vegan if I got it without the feta. They said no because they fry it on a buttery pan. I asked if they could use no butter. They said it’d take too long to wash the pan. What good is a beyond burger if it isn’t vegan?
