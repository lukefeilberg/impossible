# impossible
As someone who eats a plant-based diet and interested in plant-based meat alternatives I wanted to compare people's opinions between the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger. So in the Python Notebook above I use Selenium to scrape tweets containing either the phrase "beyond burger" or "impossible burger" then use VADER Sentiment Analysis to estimate the average sentiment of each tweet, which I finally compare through some regressions and visualizations.

The raw tweets are conatined in the .csv file above as well.
